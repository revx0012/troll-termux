# what is this for?

its just to troll/prank someone, or... as fun?
anyway, you can go around explore the scripts blah blah test them out
you can try and see which one is best for pranking.

(im not sure if this works on linux but it's made only for termux, i guess you can use it in linux?)

# is it harmless?

Of course! why would I create a dangerous script?
