# what does this do?


Okay, this...
it will say do not press enter

after you just don't listen and press enter anyway (4 times)
it spams "WHY" in rainbow colors
it never ends.

please do not abuse this script as it is harmless.
you can also exit it by doing CTRL + C

Command:

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/revx0012/troll-termux/main/scripts/ENTER_WHY/ENTER_WHY.sh && bash ENTER_WHY.sh```
