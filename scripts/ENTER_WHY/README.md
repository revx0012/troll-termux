# what does this do?


Okay, this...
it will say do not press enter

after you just don't listen and press enter anyway (4 times)
it spams "WHY DID YOU PRESS ENTER?" in rainbow colors/more colors, it never ends.

(Note: it has 100 colors.)

please do not abuse this script as it is harmless.
you can also exit it by doing CTRL + C
