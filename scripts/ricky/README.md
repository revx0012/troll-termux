# what IS THAT????

eh well once you execute it hosts a web and embeds a disguised rickroll (again, once it hosts it will automatically redirect you to the link)

# Note

once you get redirected, it autoplays the disguised rickroll video and you can't pause it.

# Requirements 

You need ``node``, if you dont have it just execute: ``pkg install -y nodejs`` then youre done!

# Command:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/revx0012/troll-termux/main/scripts/ricky/ricky.js && node ricky.js
```
